# Capstone Project Ideas

## Election Contributions
**Problem:** Future campaigns may want to know where best to target their efforts
for advertising and requests for donations.  An analysis of the 2016 primary
and general election campaign contributions could help predict how much
and to who a person may donate to based on various factors such as occupation,
location, or time the contribution was made.

## Baseball All-Star/Hall of Fame Predictor
**Problem:** A baseball professional who is responsible for player evaluation may
want to know the most important attributes that contribute to player success.
One way to measure success in baseball is for a player to be selected as an
All-Star/Hall of Fame player.  Knowing which particular statistics and
attributes help someone become an All-Star/Hall of Famer would help player 
evaluation and players themselves know what to focus on to be judged as successful.

## Predicting Human Activity Using a Smartphone
**Problem:** Many people use smartphones as fitness trackers.  Smartphones have
accelerometers and gyroscopes that record positional data that can be used
to predict what specific activity a user is performing.
